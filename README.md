# Node, Express, Postgres
## Multi model RESTFul API
differences from single model:
removed notes column from books
added notes model/schema


## async / await

* books show route uses **async / await** for retrieving relational data with multiple queries (and then packaging it inside the book object). Using **async** with the **req, res** callback apparently is fine as long as errors are accounted: [async / await in express routes](https://medium.com/@yamalight/danger-of-using-async-await-in-es7-8006e3eb7efb)

* In production multiple queries should done with a pg-promise **task**, but it is a little verbose and abstract when being introduced to pg-promise:

```javascript
router.get('/:id'. (req, res) => {
  db.task(async t => {
    const book = await t.one(Book.find, req.params.id);
    book.notes = await t.any(Note.all, req.params.id);
    return book;
  })
  .then(data => {
    res.status(200).json({ status: 'success', data, message: 'found a book' });
  })
  .catch(err => {
    res.status(400).json({ status: 'failure', data: err.message, message: 'could not find book' });
  });
});
```

Therefore, for multiple queries I stick with basic awaits within a try/catch:

```javascript
router.get('/:id', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const book = await db.one(Book.find, req.params.id);
    book.notes = await db.any(Note.all, req.params.id);
    res.status(200).json({ status: 'success', data: book, message: 'found a book' });
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(400).json({ status: 'failure', data: err.message, message: 'could not find book' })
  }
});
```


Objectives

* Write SQL for queries instead of ORM
* Multiline SQL statements in `.sql` files

"Books App" ðŸ“š

#### PG-PROMISE RESOURCES

Like pg, but with Promises instead of callbacks (and more)

* [API Basics](http://mherman.org/blog/2016/03/13/designing-a-restful-api-with-node-and-postgres/)
* [pg-promise examples from creator](https://github.com/vitaly-t/pg-promise/wiki/Learn-by-Example)
* [queryfiles usage from pg-promise creator](http://vitaly-t.github.io/pg-promise/QueryFile.html)

#### DEV NOTES

**Restart server after changes to QueryFile**

Changing a `.sql` file doesn't restart the server and reload the changes: `new QueryFile` will not re-instantiate. Restart server to instantiate new QueryFile after changing a `.sql` file.

**Errors and exceptions**

In the `.catch` clause of a db query, the base err object will appear in console but not in response (when using QueryFile). For response text, pg-promise errors from queryFile show in `err.message`.

Errors within queryfiles themselves are also possible. (commented out above)

```javascript
if (err instanceof db.$config.pgp.errors.QueryFileError) {             
	console.log('query file error', err);                                
}                                                                      
```

**Delete notes**

For DELETE I arbitrarily decided to send the deleted resource in the response: using `RETURNING *` in the sql statement. using `db.one` query in the controller, and status code of 200 (instead of 204).

**JSON notes**

JSON field: Postgres validates json, but there is no native schema validation support for nested json fields and datatypes. Relating JSON data is also problematic. Lesson-wise, this could lead into the topic of 'Normalization' and relations, and maybe some talk about "anti-patterns" using json in a relational db.

#### Postgres / SQL Resources

* [formatting](http://www.sqlstyle.guide/)
* [json](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-json/)
* [postgres reference](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/)
* [vim highlighting](https://github.com/exu/pgsql.vim)
* [validate json schema](https://github.com/gavinwahl/postgres-json-schema)
* [constraints](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/ddl-constraints.html)


#### Misc

Validation: only way to protect against empty strings is with CHECK

```sql
title VARCHAR NOT NULL CHECK (title <> '')
```



Run create db file in bash

```
$ psql -f db/create_db.sql
```

Run books schema file in bash

```
$ psql books_multi_app_api -f models/books/schema.sql
```

Run notes schema file in bash

```
$ psql books_multi_app_api -f models/notes/schema.sql
```


NOTEWORTHY ERRORS:

```
error: syntax error at or near "$"
```

If you forgot to supply an object to a 'create' or 'update' query, the QueryFile will kick up this error. It's as if it's trying to read SQL as opposed to pg-promise's named parameters syntax.

Don't do this on a create route:

Do do this instead  (include the `req.body` object as data ):

Must use **x-www-form-urlencoded** option in Postman to send data
